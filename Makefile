# Minimum total statement coverage enforced by `make test-cover`. The

# as a per-function fallback has been deleted; every emitted body now
# goes through SSA, so the threshold tracks the real per-statement
# coverage of the live codegen.

# Recalibrated 85 -> 84 when the own-emitter asm backend (internal/asmgen,
# ~20k lines) and its codegen+asmgen integration test were removed in
# favour of the gcasm backend: that integration test contributed broad
# cross-package coverage which the deleted code no longer needs, leaving
# live-code coverage at ~84.7%. The gcasm path is instead covered by its
# own gates plus the transpile end-to-end test and the consumer e2e.

# internal/asmgen and internal/lower that are exercised primarily
# through integration tests in internal/codegen.

# `-count=1` forces fresh execution: a CACHED package result merges
# incomplete coverage data into the -coverpkg profile, silently
# deflating the total by 10+ points — which made this gate a lottery
# depending on what the CI runner's restored build cache contained.
